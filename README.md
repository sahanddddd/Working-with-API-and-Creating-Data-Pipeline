The aim of this project is to examine whether the spread of cholera virus can be associated with other factors such as sanitation and access to water, as well as climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation on a global scale.
In addition, during the course of this project I will: - Create a pipeline to facilitate the retrieval of data from the different sources for each parameter. - Combine data from all parameters into one dataset. – Expand the analysis to identify any visible correlations. Prepare the dataset for the machine learning algorithm. – Evaluate the results of different machine learning algorithms by running them on the data to compare their results.
Best if opened in a Jupyter Notebook envierment and follow the instrustions to replicate the same approch.
