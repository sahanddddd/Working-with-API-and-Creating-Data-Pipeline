The goal of this project is to investigate the potential association between the spread of the cholera virus and various factors, such as sanitation, access to water, and climate indicators (temperature and precipitation) on a global scale. Throughout the course of this project, the following tasks will be accomplished:

Develop a data retrieval pipeline to streamline the process of gathering data from various sources for each parameter.
Consolidate data from all parameters into a single dataset.
Conduct an in-depth analysis to identify any observable correlations.
Prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms.
Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the data.
To get started, it is recommended to open the project in a Jupyter Notebook environment and follow the instructions provided to replicate the approach.
